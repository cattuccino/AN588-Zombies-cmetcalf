# Some of my best friends are Zombies...

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("Zombie picture.jpeg")
```
*All love to Pedro Pascal*

```{r}
library(curl)
```
First load in the document (make sure to copy raw url not just repo's):
```{r}
f <- curl("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fuzzyatelin/fuzzyatelin.github.io/master/AN588_Fall23/zombies.csv")
d <- read.csv(f, header = TRUE, sep = ",", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
head(d)
```
This data includes the first name, last name, and gender of the entire population of 1000 people who have survived the zombie apocalypse and are now ekeing out an existence somewhere on the East Coast, along with several other variables (height, weight, age, number of years of education, number of zombies they have killed, and college major).

## Calculate the population mean and standard deviation for each quantitative random variable (height, weight, age, number of zombies killed, and years of education). NOTE: You will not want to use the built in var() and sd() commands as these are for samples.

First to calculate the population mean, you can use the summary function to get a range of data for each variable, one of which is the mean:
```{r}
summary(d)
```

Then to calculate the standard deviation, we can use the sd() function just by specifying data frame and variable:
```{r}
sd(d$id)
```
Why does using sd() like this not work? 

```{r}
sd(d$height)
```

## Use {ggplot} to make boxplots of each of these variables by gender.

First have to load in packages with library() and then outline graphics such as what you are going "by" using filter and then what variable is being measured. You can also color the boxes using the scale_fill_manual command and even add a title. Also this solution is taken from Week 3 modules that was Jimmy's example becuase this provided a clear example as well as piping to make it one code block. 
```{r}
library(ggplot2) #have to load in correct packages!
library(dplyr)
d %>% filter(gender == "Female" | gender == "Male") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = height, fill = gender)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("purple", "blue")) +
  ggtitle("Boxplot of Height by Gender") + theme_bw()

d %>% filter(gender == "Female" | gender == "Male") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = weight, fill = gender)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("purple", "blue")) +
  ggtitle("Boxplot of Weight by Gender") + theme_bw()

d %>% filter(gender == "Female" | gender == "Male") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = zombies_killed, fill = gender)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("purple", "blue")) +
  ggtitle("Boxplot of Zombies Killed by Gender") + theme_bw()

d %>% filter(gender == "Female" | gender == "Male") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = years_of_education, fill = gender)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("purple", "blue")) +
  ggtitle("Boxplot of Years of Education by Gender") + theme_bw()

d %>% filter(gender == "Female" | gender == "Male") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = age, fill = gender)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("purple", "blue")) +
  ggtitle("Boxplot of Age by Gender") + theme_bw()
```


## Use {ggplot} to make scatterplots of height and weight in relation to age. Do these variables seem to be related? In what way?

We would use a bivariate scatterplot here:
```{r}
p <- ggplot(data = d, aes(x = age, y = height))
p <- p + geom_point()
p <- p + geom_smooth(method = "lm")
p
```

Now for weight:
```{r}
p <- ggplot(data = d, aes(x = age, y = weight))
p <- p + geom_point()
p <- p + geom_smooth(method = "lm")
p
```

They do seem to be related in that the majority is around 20 years of age for both variables and concentrate around a positive sloped line of best fit.

## Using histograms and Q-Q plots, check whether the quantitative variables seem to be drawn from a normal distribution. Which seem to be and which do not (hint: not all are drawn from the normal distribution)? For those that are not normal, can you determine from which common distribution they are drawn?

```{r}
qqnorm(d$height, main = "Normal QQ plot Height") 
qqline(d$height, col = "gray") 
```
```{r}
hist(d$height, main = "Histogram of Height",
     xlab = "Height")
```
Points of the QQ plot lie pretty evenly on the line and the histogram shows equal distribution with it peaking around the mean, so these appear normal.

```{r}
qqnorm(d$weight, main = "Normal QQ plot Weight") 
qqline(d$weight, col = "gray") 

hist(d$weight, main = "Histogram of Weight",
     xlab = "Weight")
```
Weight does the same as height with centering along the line and concentrating amongst the mean, so also a relatively normal distribution.

```{r}
qqnorm(d$zombies_killed, main = "Normal QQ plot Zombies Killed") 
qqline(d$zombies_killed, col = "gray") 

hist(d$zombies_killed, main = "Histogram of Zombies Killed",
     xlab = "Zombies Killed")
```
This qqplot and histogram appear not normal, with the histogram being skewed left (lower tail) and the qqplot not falling evenly on the line at all. It likely belongs to a...

```{r}
qqnorm(d$years_of_education, main = "Normal QQ plot Years of Education") 
qqline(d$years_of_education, col = "gray") 

hist(d$years_of_education, main = "Histogram of Years of Education",
     xlab = "Years of Education")
```
Similar to the zombies killed plot, this also is not a normal distribution. The histogram is skewed towards the lower tail and the qqplot is in platforms instead of falling along the line. 

```{r}
qqnorm(d$age, main = "Normal QQ plot Age") 
qqline(d$age, col = "gray") 

hist(d$age, main = "Histogram of Age",
     xlab = "Age")
```
The age plots appear to be a normal distribution, again being concentrated around the line in the qqplot and peaking around the mean in the histogram with only small variation.

## Now use the sample() function to sample ONE subset of 30 zombie survivors (without replacement) from this population and calculate the mean and sample standard deviation for each variable. Also estimate the standard error for each variable, and construct the 95% confidence interval for each mean. Note that for the variables that are not drawn from the normal distribution, you may need to base your estimate of the CIs on slightly different code than for the normalâ€¦

## Now draw 99 more random samples of 30 zombie apocalypse survivors, and calculate the mean for each variable for each of these samples. Together with the first sample you drew, you now have a set of 100 means for each variable (each based on 30 observations), which constitutes a sampling distribution for each variable. What are the means and standard deviations of this distribution of means for each variable? How do the standard deviations of means compare to the standard errors estimated in [5]? What do these sampling distributions look like (a graph might help here)? Are they normally distributed? What about for those variables that you concluded were not originally drawn from a normal distribution?

For this we can use rpois or rnorm.
